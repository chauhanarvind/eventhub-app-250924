        <h1 className={styles.title}>Welcome to EventHub!</h1>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          Born out of the vibrant community of students and residents at the
          University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, EventHub was created
          with a simple yet powerful vision: to connect people with their
          community and local culture through a unified platform.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          When we first arrived in Hamilton, we quickly realized that staying in
          the loop about local events was a challenge. The city was brimming
          with exciting opportunities, but finding out about them often felt
          like a game of chance—relying on word of mouth or stumbling across
          random social media posts. We knew there had to be a better way.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          And so, EventHub was born. Our mission is to bring all the incredible
          happenings in Hamilton into one central location. Imagine a place
          where you can effortlessly explore, discover, and participate in the
          rich tapestry of events that make our city so unique. Whether its a
          concert, festival, workshop, or community gathering, EventHub is your
          go-to source for all things happening in Hamilton.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          For event-goers, EventHub offers a streamlined experience to browse
          events, access detailed information, and easily purchase tickets or

          visibility, reach a larger audience, and boost participation and
